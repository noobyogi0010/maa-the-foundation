**MAA-The Foundation** is a non-profit organization founded and run by Mr. Ankit Ranga (Certified Yoga Instructor). The mission of **MAA - The Foundation** is to provide literacy to the under-previlaged children. This mission is not only limited to teaching children how to read, and write but also to make sure that they understand different aspects of life. For Mr. Ranga, the concept of literacy is much more beyond it's literal meaning. He along with is team are teaching these children to success in life and lead a happy, hygenic and healthy lifestyle.
